--> A Bengali Programming Language where all syntax in Bengali language and it is written python

## Introduction
A programming language of Bengali syntax is created using python, which has functions, variables, statements, basic binary operations, and more.  The funniest part of this language is that I used an interpreter to make an interpreter.

## Motivation
The primary motivation I developed behind this language after witnessing the difficulties of teaching Bangladeshi schoolchildren programming. They are more comfortable learning everything in their mother tongue. In 2018, I taught my neighborâ€™s (13 years old) programming and faced difficulties teaching him. Later I found that he could understand the logic and syntax more clearly in Bengali than in English. So, I started developing a language in Bengali, and we know that we are all more comfortable in talking and understanding in the mother tongue.
